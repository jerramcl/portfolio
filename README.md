# Hi, I'm Jerra!

I’m a data analyst with a focus on civic tech and public policy, currently pursuing a Masters degree in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley. My goal is to work at the intersection of data and government, to build tools and analyses that make public institutions more transparent, equitable, and effective.

My path into this work has been shaped by both academic training and lived experience. I earned my B.A. in Economics and Sociology at UC Santa Barbara, where I worked as a research assistant on a [sociological study of mass shootings in America](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37214768/). Through this project, I saw firsthand how data can be used to tell stories, uncover patterns, and support evidence-based change.

Currently, I’m deepening my technical toolkit by developing skills in Python, R, SQL, while continuing to work on mission-driven projects. Most recently, I partnered with [Ten Strands](https://tenstrands.org/work/data-initiative/), a non-profit focused on Environmental Literacy within K-12 schools, to analyze environmental policy language from over 700 California school districts. I helped build a scalable data pipeline to extract, clean, and analyze policy documents, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like topic modeling, semantic similarity and quantitaive techniques like regression analysis to identify language associated with stronger climate action.

I’m especially motivated by work that combines data, policy, and social impact! I’m excited to contribute to projects that help communities and public institutions navigate complex challenges with clarity and care.

### Analytical Skills 
Through rigorous graduate coursework at UC Berkeley, data-related interships and projects, I’ve developed advanced programming and analytical capabilities at the intersection of data science and social impact. My work spans the full data lifecycle; from engineering robust computing environments to interpreting statistical models for real-world decision-making.

- Proficent in Python for scientific computing and machine learning using pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and spaCy.
- Built ML pipelines for regression, classification, natural language processing, and causal inference, including Large Language Model fine-tuning.
- Conducted statistical analysis in R and Python—using regression, hypothesis testing, RCTs, IVs, and panel data—to answer policy and social science questions.
- Engineered reproducible data pipelines for ingesting, cleaning, and transforming multi-source data (CSV, JSON, SQL, GeoJSON) using tools like pandas and tidyverse.

## Projects
- [NLP on CA School Board Policies](https://github.com/jerramcl/school-board-NLP)

    I analyzed environmental school board policies from 700+ California school districts by extracting text from PDFs using Python (fitz, pdf2image,  pytesseract) and cleaning the data with regex and NLP tools. Using regression analysis, semantic similarity, and topic modeling, I explored whether specific policy language correlates with climate action. I created visualizations—including graphs and word clouds—to highlight key patterns and developed a scalable, replicable framework for qualitative policy analysis. The goal was to understand if school board policy language affects implentation of climate friendly action on campuses across California.

- [Investments in Public Transportation on Property Values](https://github.com/jerramcl/transportation-project/tree/main)

    I analyzed the impact of the BART Warm Springs extension on local property values using data from the Zillow API, U.S. Census, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employing an OLS regression model, I accounted for multicollinearity in time-series data and corrected for heteroskedasticity to improve the model’s reliability.

- [Gender Disparities within the Workplace](https://github.com/jerramcl/women-at-work/tree/main)
  
   This project analyzes gender-based inequalities in salary and leadership representation using data from the National Survey of College Graduates. Through linear and logistic regression modeling, I show that women—especially those with advanced degrees or in the business sector—consistently earn less and are underrepresented in top leadership roles. The analysis highlights how race, education, and family status shape women’s career outcomes and underscores the need for targeted equity interventions.

- [Displacement Risk in LA and SF Counties](https://github.com/jerramcl/rent-burden)

   This project compares displacement risk between Los Angeles and San Francisco counties by analyzing factors such as rent burden, health outcomes, and demographic vulnerability. Using data from the CDC, U.S. Census, and other sources, the study evaluates median rent costs, chronic illness prevalence, and at-risk populations, including renters, homeowners, racial groups, seniors, and children. Findings indicate that LA County faces a greater risk of displacement due to higher rent burden, poorer health outcomes, and a larger proportion of marginalized populations.
